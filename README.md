# warehouse-api
Implementation a warehouse software API with [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).

## Requirements
For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 11](https://adoptopenjdk.net/?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=hotspot)
- [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org)

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `com.ikea.assignment.warehouse.WarehouseApiApplication` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Swagger definition
Once application is running with above-mentioned steps, API documentation can be accessed via [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html).

### Lombok Annotations
This project packages the annotations of [Project Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) as separate JAR to improve compiling and handling Java sources generated by [Delombok](https://projectlombok.org/features/delombok).

### mapper Annotations (Mapstruct)
This project packages the annotations and implementation of mapstruct library [Mapstruct](https://mapstruct.org/)
Make sure to run locally maven build (like below) to generate mapper implementations.
```shell
mvn clean install
```

* In future iterations, 
  * enhancements can be done with upload new products with supporting different upload file formats with inventory details with it
  * enhancements can be done with upload new products with supporting different upload file formats.
  * More enhanced test cases.
  * better security implementation based on roles
